Release 1.5
2010-09-09	Fixed inconsistent blocking (bug 59).  Replaced defined routine
		in sgDB.c
2010-09-08	Added Russian translation from Vladimir Ipatov to squidGuard.cgi.in.
2009-10-19	Fixed two bypass problems with URLs which length is close to 
		the limit defined by MAX_BUF. The resulting proxy line exceeds
		this limit and causes either squid or squidGuard to properly
		block a site.
2009-10-15	Fixed a problem with very long URLs. SquidGuard will go into 
		emergency mode when a overlong URLs are encountered. The
		emergency mode causes an entire stop of blocking. This is not
		appropriate in this situation.
2009-09-30	Added patch by beber and gentoo (thank you!) to fix a 
		problem when cross compiling (bug 56).
2009-09-27	Added patch by gentoo to fix alocal warnings (bug 57).
2009-09-15	Added a feature to send log messages to syslog based on the
		patch from Jun Jiang (thank you). (bug 42)  In order to use
		syslog you have to run configure with the new option
		"--with-syslog". In the configuration file you need to add
		a line "syslog enable". If any other value but "enable" is
		used syslog is disabled and logging to squidGuard.log takes
		place as usual.
		The following log level are used: DEBUG, NOTICE, WARN, ERROR
		and EMERG. The local4 syslog facility is used by default.
		If you want to change this, use the configure option
		"--with-syslog-facility=<facility>".
2009-09-12	Anonymized passwords (for connecting to the ldap or mysql 
		server) written to logfiles when squidGuard is starting.
		Added two configure options for choosing different location
		for the LDAP include and library files.
2009-08-25	Added patch to check IP addresses against LDAP. Patch by
		Denis Bonnenfant (bug 41) - thank you.
2009-08-23	Added patch to allow quoted strings in the configuration
		file (bug 53). For more information see README.QuotedStrings.
		Thanks to Iain Fothergill for providing the patch.
		Removed the fix for usernames starting with a number because
		it breaks the time declarations.
2009-05-08	Added patch by INL to enable blocking against DNS based
		blacklists (bug 55).
		Fixed re-opened bug 12: a problem with regular expressions.
		An entry like "www\.google\.de" did not block www.google.de
		which it was supposed to do. Solving this issue solved
		bug 46 as well.
2009-03-08	Fixed bug 52: Sometimes squidGuard crashes with an overflow
		error message for vsprintf. Thanks to Dirk Schoebel for 
		suggesting the proper fix.
		Fixed bug 49: Using numeric username made squidGuard goes
		into emergency mode. This has been fixed. Usernames can
		now start with a number, be numeric and can additionally
		contain the following characters: @,à,é,è,ñ,á,ì,í,ò,ó,ù,ú.


Release 1.4
2008-12-23	Included last fixes for 1.4 final.
2008-07-23	Some cleanup and fine work: added information about "-b"
		parameter to the help output. Added "!" to the list of
		allowed characters in urls.
2008-07-14	Fixed bug40: When an url ended in "://" squidGuard crashed.
		This has been fixed (the end of the url is now tested).
		Fixed bug39: squid was complaining about stdout messages from 
		squidGuard during the db update as a result of the progress
		bar output. The output has been moved to stderr.
2008-07-11	Added a switch to turn on the progress bar. The old default
		behaviour has been restored to not show anything. To see the
		progress of the compilation of the db files, use the command
			squidGuard -b
		(-b for "bar" - the progressbar).
2008-07-05	Fixed bug 37: The sample block script squidGuard.cgi has been
		rewritten to fix some bugs (basically warnings due to old perl
		syntax but problem with the language selection as well) and to
		enable an easier integration of additional languages. If a new
		language shall be supported create a babel file the same way
		the others are build and add the language to the supported hash
		in squidGuard.cgi. The location of the babel files is the same
		as for squidGuard.cgi. If you want to change the location change
		the path in squidGuard.cgi (line 298).
		The layout of the block page has been improved a bit as well.
		Fixed bug 23: Syntax error when using "~" in redirect statement.
		The "~" was not in the list of allowed characters for the
		redirect url.
		Fixed bug 34: On some system y.tab.c and y.tab.h were not properly
		created although bison was installed. This led to errors during
		compilation. If now no _executable_ bison is found, make copies
		the files over. The prepared files have been updated, too.
2008-06-13	Fixed bug 38: Bypass vulnerability using trailing dots. This 
		problem only occurs when squid 3.0 is used. Squid 2.6 removes
		trailing dots from domains before passing them to squidGuard.
2008-05-17	Removed the automatic download of the documentation when running
		"make install". From now on the documentation will be updated as
		part of the release.
2008-05-15	Corrected bugs 31 and 35: The "make install" command now tests
		if the directory of the configuration file exists. If it is not
		existing, the directory is created. 
		If flex/lex is not installed "make" gave errors instead of just
		copying the prepared flex file. If no flex/lex is found during
		the configure run, "make" checks again and copies the prepared
		file now fine.
2008-04-18	Added MySQL support for authentication based on a patch from
		Chris Fletcher (thank you). (bug 19.) Tested with MySQL 5.0.
		To use MySQL configure must be started with the new option
		"--with-mysql". If MySQL is not installed under   /usr   or 
		/usr/local   you can specify a directory with this option. The
		database is assumed to be configured on localhost.
		Four new statements are required for MySQL support in the 
		configuration file: 
		mysqlusername (user to connect to the database)
		mysqlpassword (password to authenticate 'mysqlusername')
		mysqldb (database to use within mysql)
		userquery (the sql query WITHOUT the trailing ';')
2008-04-16	Fixed configure.in to comply with the autoconf standard and
		produced an updated version of configure. As a result a couple
		of configure options changed their syntax:
		. to set the squid runtime user use --with-squiduser=<username>
		  (default is "squid")
		. to suppress log messages except for start and stop messages
		  use:  --with-nolog=yes  (default is "no").
2008-03-12      Fixed broken "make test" (bug 17).
		Adjusted version.h.
2008-03-12	Added new runtime parameter "-P". This parameter changes
		the default behaviour from stop (emergency mode) to pass
		when an error in building the database files occurs. So
		this parameter only works in connection with the runtime
		paramter "-C". Before using "-P" in your environment
		make sure that nothing breakes when the building of the
		db files fail.
2008-01-19	Included some changes of a set of patches collated or 
		developed by Chris Pates and Iain Fothegill of the CLEO 
		Systems at Lancaster University
2007-12-31	Added Spanish translation to squidGuard.cgi (thank you, Samuel
		García for the translation) (bug 26).
		

Release 1.3
2007-09-19	Included configurable logging. New configure option --nolog
		suppress all runtime logmessages. Start and stop is still logged.
		Default behaviour is now to log the non debug messages except
		when the runtime option -d is supplied to squidGuard. May need
		some more finetuning in later versions. (bug 11)
		Made some slight changes to the outdated FAQ file.
2007-09-13	Modified auth code to work with and without ldap (choosing
		subroutine rfc1738_unescape or sgFindUser in sg.y.in)
2007-08-20	Corrected include statement in sg.h.in.
2007-07-16	Added patch by Marc Clayton to include a progressbar to the
	 	build of the database files (bug 6).
2007-07-01	Added patch by Eric Harrison to enable full sed compliance
		to rewrite statements (bug 7).
2007-06-02	Corrected missing evaluation of configure parameters for
		logdir, dbhome and config file (bug 11).
2007-05-25	Added patch from satish to block urls entries that include
		hostnames (bug 4).
2007-05-20	Fixed broken regex evaluation (bug 12)
		Fixed a compile problem on some systems (bug 10).
2007-05-10	Corrected an issue with the fix for the double
		slash vulnerability (incorrectly found double
		slashes) (bug 1). 


Release 1.2.1
2007-04-10      Fixed multiple slash bypass vulnerabilty.
2007-03-17	Fixed some bugs in squidGuard-simple.cgi and added a
		German version of it.
2007-03-16	Fixed encoding bypass vulnerabilty.
2007-03-16	Updated y.tab.c.bison and y.tab.h.bison to the recent
		version.
2007-02-02	Fixed bug in user authentication.
2007-01-20	Fixed some typos which broke compilation on Sun Solaris
		when using the Sun CC compiler.
2007-01-12	Corrected unproper evaluated if-clause, which broke the
		BerkeleyDB 2 compatibility.
		Fixed minor typo in samples/Makefile.in.
2006-12-29	Replaced the sleepycat links from the configure program with
		the oracle links.
		Corrected typo in Makefile.in.
2006-12-16	Removed a stupid bug from the Makefile in the docs directory.
2006-12-10	Removed references to squidguard.org in Makefile.in in the
		Doc directory (squidguard.org is down).
		Added ISSUES.txt file about known problem with the current
		code (any information that is missing and should go in there
		is gladly welcomed).
2006-06-17	Release now supports LDAP queries for authentication:
		Added Chris Frey's ldap patches and fixes (03, 05, 06,
		07 and 10; Patches from:
		http://www.netdirect.ca/software/category.php?cat=SquidGuard).
		The LDAP feature can be included during the configure run
		by setting --with-ldap. Per default ldap support will not
		be compiled in.
		Added a fix provided by Francesco Ranieri to solve an issue
		with the (un)escaping of the authentication "domain%5cusername".

Patch Release 1.2.0p3

2005-12-09	Modfied configure Skript to allow to specify the name of 
		the useraccount the squid cache is using.
		Modified Makefile.in that during the installation the
		necessary squidGuard directories are created if they are
		not existing. Additionally a default configuration file
		will be copied to the default location for squidGuard unless
		an old one is found there. 

Patch Release 1.2.0p2

2005-10-13	Added Adam Gorski's bugfix to correct a a null pointer access
	 	bug in logging.
		Added Chris Freys bugfix a bug where it won't search the url
		db if the domain db is empty. 
		Added Chris Frey's buffer overflow checks (except for commenting
		out the part from line 446 to 470 in sgDb.c).
		(Patches from: 
		http://www.netdirect.ca/software/category.php?cat=SquidGuard)

Patch Release 1.2.0p1

2005-10-11      Added support for Berkeley DB 4.x

Changes in release 1.2.0:

2001-06-01	The source block takes a new argument: continue. With this
		command an ipaddress or user can be configured in serval 
		sourceblocks. If a client is found but not blocked, squidGuard
		will continue to search in the next source block, if the 
		continue command is defined. Thanks to Valentin Chopov 
		<valentin@valcho.net> for the patch
2001-06-01	Fixed configure.in so that it detects the supported
		db lib.
2001-05-15 	Userquota: userqouta <seconds> <sporadic> <renew>
		<renew> can be hourly|dayly|weekly|seconds. <sporadic>
		if a request comes within the number of seconds given
		in the sporadic field the remaining time of the user will
		decrease. userquota 3600 60 14400, gives the user one hour
		surfing every 4th hour. If a user have a pause for more 
		than a minute, the used timed does not increase.

		userquota 3600 0 14400, gives the user one hour surfing
		every 4th hour. userquota 3600 0 daily gies the user
		one hour surfing a day.
2001-05-11	Userquota. In an source block you can now write 
		"userquota seconds hourly|daily|weekly". This meens that
		a timer starts ticking when a user access an url. The user
		is blocked when the time is used up. The user does not get
		access until the next hour,day or week. userquota 3600 daily,
		gives the user one hour surfing a day. 
2001-03-02	Support for 3.2.* version of BerkleyDB. Previous version of
		bdb 3.* is not suported. SquidGuard is still 2.7.7 compatible.
		configure will check for vallid versions of bdb. (leh)

Changes in release 1.1.5:

2000-04-25	Removed dependency on LYNX in doc/Makefile.in. This should
		make reported /bin/false dependency problems on some
		platforms go away. (pb)

Changes in release 1.1.4:

2000-03-27	old .db files is now truncated (with the DB_TRUNCATE flagg) 
		instead of removed (with unlink syscall) when running with the
		-C option. defined() can now return DB_NOTFOUND. DB_NOTFOUND
		from defined() indicates an empty database (leh)
2000-03-27      %f in redirects will expand to file part of the url (leh)
2000-03-27      the sgReloadConfig moved to the end of the while loop (leh)

		open filehandle (leh)
2000-03-21	sgReloadConfig closes the logfile and all DBs before exec(leh)
2000-03-21	a sigHUP only sets a flag, sgReloadConfig is then called in the
		main loop (leh)
2000-03-21	the %u macro is not affected by the %xx decoding (leh)
2000-03-09	uses sigaction() instead of signal() for masking the HUP 
		signal, With signal() the HUP signal would only work once 
		(on FreeBSD and Linux systems) (leh)	
2000-03-09	squidGuard would core when no pass statement was defined
		in an acl block (specially when expanding the %t macro in the 
		redirect statement) (leh)
2000-03-07	leading spaces in the redirect field in destination files 
		are removed. Defined RM = rm -f in Makefiles.in (Not defined
		on FreeBSD 3.4) Thanks to Michail Vidiassov 
		<master@iaas.msu.ru> for patch (leh)

Changes in release 1.1.3:

2000-03-06	ident information is processed in lowercase (leh)

1999-12-07	two redirect bugs in sgDb.c  defined() function fixed (leh)

Changes in release 1.1.1:

1999-11-02	fixed possible problem in the time scheduler when internal
		clock has been changed by some external source like ntp (leh)
1999-10-29      You can now define more than one timerange on a line in 
                the configfile: date 1999-*-* 08:00-09:00 16:00-18:00. So
                now, at last is the doc right. Thanks to Andrew (red@skazna.ru)

		} (leh)
1999-09-30      All rewrites now works on the original url not the
		stripped version. (leh)
1999-09-24      SquidGuard now goes into emergency mode if default acl is 
                missing in the configfile (leh)
1999-09-24      logfile will be placed relative to logdir (leh)
1999-09-23      cleanup in the regexp functions. You can now use the @g switch
                to substitute all occurences of a string. Uptil now only the
                first one would be substituted (leh)
1999-09-21	fixed a bug with cidr/mask notation in iplist and a bug

1999-09-17      .db files will be opened with 644 mode (664 mode prev) (leh)
1999-09-17      fixed rewrite logging, the request log is now on the 
		format: Request(src/dest/rew) url src/domain ident method (leh)
1999-09-13      fixed bug in the domainCompare function. Thanks again
                to Fabrice Prigent's contribution (leh)
1999-09-13	added sgclean perl script. Use it to remove redudant entries
		in domain and url files. Look in the contrib dir (leh) 
1999-09-10	fixed bug in string returned to squid during rewrite (leh)

Changes in release 1.1.0:

1999-08-24	Brought the doc up to date. (pb)

Changes in release 1.1.0.beta1:

1999-08-23	fixed bug with userlists. squidGuard used wrongly DB_SET_RANGE 
		flag when searching for users. Thanks to Joseph Lesko
                <joe@nationnet.com> for patch. (leh)
1999-08-06      A redirect string now expands %p to the path part of an url.
                So you could do something like this in a url file: 
                ftp.linux.org/kernel/v2 ftp.yournet.com/%p (Thanks again to 
                Jiri A. Randus pointing out the need of %p) (leh)
1999-08-05      squidGuard will now save case in the url when doing rewrite,
                and the %u macro will now expand to the original url instead
		of the lowercase version (Thanks to Jiri A. Randus 
		(Jiri.Randus@inway.cz) for finding this bug) (leh)
1999-08-05      fixed seg fault bug in the rewrite function (Thanks to
                Jiri A. Randus (Jiri.Randus@inway.cz) for patch) (leh)
1999-08-02	autoconf now uses /usr/local/BerkleyDB instead of 
		$prefix/BerkleyDB. use --with-db=DIR to change location.(leh)
1999-07-30      seg fault bug fixed, seg faulted if lines in expressionlists
	 	didn't have newline (!) (leh)
1999-07-26	updated usage function (leh)
1999-07-26	Two new switches to squidGuard -u and -C. If squidGuard is 
		started with the "-C block" argument. squidGuard will make
		a .db files out of the domain/url files belonging to that
		destination block. An existsing .db file will be removed before
		a new file is created. The argument "-C all" will create .db
		files for all domain/url files found (look at the fix of 
		1999-06-15). 
		If squidGuard is started with -u. SquidGuard will look for
		.diff files in the directory where the domain/urls files
  		lies. squidGuard will add lines to the .db file if a line in 
		the .diff begins with a '+', and remove it, if the line begins
		with a '-'. (leh)
1999-07-26	fix of 1999-06-21 broke the lexer so that an ip adresses 
		begining with the number 3 would be parsed as a word not 
		as an ipaddress. The lexer now uses states to fix this (leh)
1999-07-26      squidGuard logs a error if a logfile command is inserted into
		an acl other than "default". The logfile command should be
                used in the source block instead.(leh) 
1999-07-14	changed the parseLine function so it doesn't strip www|ftp 
                when searching in the domain base. urls searches will be
	        done with stripped url. (leh)
1999-07-14	fixed small bug in parsing of date wildcard format, ignored 
                dot as separator. Now dot and dash can be used (leh)
1999-07-09	Removed trailing slashes for DEFAULT_LOGDIR and DEFAULT_DBHOME
		in src/sg.h.in (pb)
1999-06-28	Renamed the blacklists "blacklist" so people don't jump
		too easy into wrong conclusions in case they get a glimpse
		of your screen.. (pb)
1999-06-21	Problems with redirects commands begining with 301|302:http...,
		fixed regexp in sg.l to cope with this (leh) 
1999-06-16	Added automatic fallback to prebuilt versions of y.tab.c,
		y.tab.h and lex.yy.c to make it easier for those who have
		problems with their yacc or lex (pb)
1999-06-16	Added a prerelease of the squidGuardRobot in contrib (pb)
1999-06-15	When loading urllist and domainlist squidGuard checks if a
		.db file exists. If it does it will use the db
		file instead of loading the textfile into memory. This will
		speed up the initialization of squidGuard, and limit the
		memory usage. (leh)
1999-06-15	Fixed a bug with empty dest blocks, and dest blocks under time
		control. Pre 1.1 an empty destblock would stop further 
		checks of the pass statment. Now an empty destblock will be 
		ignored	(leh)
1999-06-10	Added French texts to samples/squidGuard.cgi thanks to
		Fabrice Prigent (pb)
1999-06-09	Changed all functions and prototypes to start support for
		both ANSI and old K&R C (pb)
1999-06-09	Added own yywrap() (pb)

Changes in release 1.0.0:

1999-06-07	squidGuard skips chars after the first ':' in an userlist.
		You can use this for something like: userlist /etc/passwd (leh)

Changes in release 1.0.0.beta3:

1999-06-03	Changed the test requestst to be more realistic. (pb)
1999-06-02	squdiGuard takes a new commandline argument:
		-t yyyy-mm-ddTHH:MM:SS, and uses the value to -t in every
		time calculation in squidGuard. With this you can easily 
		test your time blocks without altering the config all the 
		time. (leh)

Changes in release 1.0.0.beta2:

1999-05-31	The default acl block can take a log|logfile argument (leH)
1999-05-31	A substitution in a rewrite block now can take a [rR]
		argument in addition to [i]. With the lowercase r 
		squidGuard will return an 302 (redirect temporarily) code
		in front of the rewritten url. And an 301 (redirect permanent) 
		with the uppercase R. (leh)
1999-05-28	A src block can have a "userlist filename" command. (leh)
1999-05-27	More cleaning in Makefiles.in and configure.in
		Removed less portable :sh= dependencies
		Added make tar (pb)
1999-05-26	Completed the documentation (pb)
1999-05-26	The global logfunctions now uses the same logfunctions 
		that the logfile command in the configfile. This means 
		one open filedescriptor per file. The file is also open
		for writing aslong as squidGuard is running. (leh)
1999-05-26	/dev/null as configfile will pass all (not seg fault) (leh)
1999-05-25	configure now takes --with-sg-dbhome=DIR argument (leh)
1999-05-20	src blocks can have a "iplist filename" command where the
		ipaddresses of a src block is stored in the file "filename". 
		The file can look like this:
		#
		# iplist file for the admin src block
		#
		1.2.3.4-1.2.3.10 # the managers
		1.2.4.0/24	# the servers
		1.2.5.3 1.2.6.0/255.255.255.0 #the rest		  (leh)
1999-05-20	Added time support for the rewrite block (leh)
1999-05-20	Added new log functionality. The source, destination and
		rewrite blocks now take log|logfile commands. You can 
		write 
		src client {
			    user root
			    log anonymous /log/client.log
		}

		squidGuard will then log every redirects triggered by
		the user root. The ident entry in the logfile will be "-". (leh)
1999-05-19	dbfiles can have #comments (leh)
1999-05-18	removed the hostpart stripping functionality from version 
		0.0.9. Now only www[0-9]*, web[0-9]* and ftp[0-9]* will
		be stripped from the hostpart of an url. (leh)
1999-05-18	empty src blocks made some problems. Every src/dest block
		is now terminated with a call to sgSourceEnd/sgDestEnd. The
		functions check if a block is empty, and sets it to
		innactive if that's the case. (leh)
1999-05-18	fixed some very dangerous memmory allocations. I forgot to add
		1 to some of the strlen() calls. Thanks to Bruce Perens's
		tool ElectricFence, for findig these ugly bugs so fast. (leh)

1999-04-21	The pass command in an acl block got a new predefined
		destination token "in-addr"
		
		acl lan {
			pass good !in-addr !adult any
		}

		all urls witch is not found in good or adult and the
		hostpart is an ipaddress will be stopped. If the url does
		not contains an ipaddress then squidGuard will continue
		with the next token ("any" in this example) (leh)
	
1999-04-30	New time function: (leh)

		The config file can now take a new object; time <name> 
	
		The time object has to be configured before the src and
		dest blocks 
		
		time workhours {
			weekly mtwhf	 08:00 - 16:00
			1999-12-24	 08:00 - 12:00
			1999-06-10 - 1999-06-20
			*-*-01		 08:00 - 16:00 # every first in month
			*-05-17		 08:00 - 16:00 # every 17 may
		}

		the workhours object can now be used in the src and dest
		block like this:

		src lan {
			ip ....
			within workhours
		}	 

		dest good {
			urllist -
			outside workhours
		}

		or in the acl block

		acl {
			lan within workhours {
				pass good !ipaddress !adult any
			} else {
				pass any
			}
		  
			default {
				....
			}
		 }

Changes in release 0.9.11:

1999-05-18	Added some ; in the yacc code, so yacc, not only bison
		can compile. (leh)

Changes in release 0.9.10:

1999-04-07	If protocol is https squids sends a line to squidGuard
		without the https:// in the url. Pre 0.9.10 squidGuard would 
		skip the line and log an error. Now squidGuard sets the 
		protocol to "unknown", and continues to parse the rest of the
		line (leh)
1999-03-31	fixed bug in parseLine (leh)

Changes in release 0.9.9:

1999-03-16	sgDbLoadTextFile will now strip user:pass, hostpart
		and :port from the url before it's loaded into the db. So 
		user:passwd@www.yyy.xxx.com:80/~some/index.html will be 
		loaded as xxx.com/~some/index.html. The same goes for the 
		strippedurl in the SquidInfo struct. If a line in the urllist
		begins with a '.',  the hostpart of the url will be unchanged.
		The line .abc.def.ghi.com:80/index.html in a urllist textfile 
		will be loaded as abc.def.ghi.com/index.html (leh)
	
Changes in release 0.9.8:

1999-03-15	Rewrite of the function parsing the url from squid.

		redirect field after the key (separted by space or tab). (leh) 
1999-03-08	A dest block can now take redirect and rewrite 
		directives as in the acl block. If both redirect and
		rewrite is defined only redirect will be used. Both
		directives will be triggered if one of domainlist, urllist
		or expressionlist matches whith the destination url (leh)
1999-03-08	squidGuard -v shows, beside the squidGuard version,
		the BerkleyDB version (leh)
